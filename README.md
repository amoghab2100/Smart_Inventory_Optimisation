# Smart_Inventory_Optimization

This is the ML model for optimization of inventory management. I've used Random Forest Classifier to predict the items into categories of higher, mid & lower priorities. According to priorities, the action would be taken to manage the inventory.
Right now, just an ML model is ready and now I'm working on its frontend and APIs with real-time DB.
